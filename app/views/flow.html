		This product was developed as a part of CS 147 - Stanfordâ€™s course on HCI+Design, where we started from needfinding and user testing, to low-fi paper prototypes, to mid-fi digital interactive prototypes, and finally to an iOS hi-fidelity prototype. I played the role of a product designer and engineer in a team of three.
